As a former computer science major, so far everything seems to have been pretty easy. Some problems with the _DataCamp_, it doesn't always accept correct R scripts. I expect to learn abour using R to do my statistical work in my Thesis. Previously I have used _SPSS_, but always seemed to be lacking in the programming side. At least for now, R seems more familiar as a language due to, again, my former computer science experience.
